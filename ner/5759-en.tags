I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,PRP VBD VBG DT NN IN PRP$ NN NN NN WRB DT NN VBD PRP VBD RB VBN PRP$ NN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN .
She informed me that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,PRP VBD PRP IN PRP MD RB VB DT NN IN DT NN VBD VBN .
"When I asked why , she explained that it was necessary to compare the signature I had just signed on the receipt .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"WRB PRP VBD WRB , PRP VBD IN PRP VBD JJ TO VB DT NN PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT NN ."
So I signed the credit card in front of her .,O O O O O O O O O O O,IN PRP VBD DT NN NN IN NN IN PRP .
She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just signed on the receipt .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,PRP RB VBD DT NN TO DT CD PRP VBD RB VBN IN DT NN .
"As luck would have it , they matched .",O O O O O O O O O,"IN NN MD VB PRP , PRP VBD ."
