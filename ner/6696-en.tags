"In the old days , when men were allowed to have many wives , a middle-aged Man had one wife that was old and one that was young ; each loved him very much , and desired to see him like herself .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"IN DT JJ NNS , WRB NNS VBD VBN TO VB JJ NNS , DT JJ NN VBD CD NN WDT VBD JJ CC CD WDT VBD JJ ; DT VBD PRP RB RB , CC VBN TO VB PRP IN PRP ."
