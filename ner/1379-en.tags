A group of climate researchers says there is evidence that global warming is causing the Antarctic ice cap to melt more quickly than it did 10 years ago .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-tim O O O,DT NN IN NN NNS VBZ EX VBZ NN IN JJ NN VBZ VBG DT JJ NN NN TO VB RBR RB IN PRP VBD CD NNS RB .
The scientists said Monday they used satellite data to monitor the Antarctic coastline .,O O O B-tim O O O O O O O O O O,DT NNS VBD NNP PRP VBD NN NNS TO VB DT JJ NN .
They found the ice sheet on the Earth 's southern pole lost 59 percent more ice in 2006 than it did in 1996 .,O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O O O B-tim O O O O B-tim O,PRP VBD DT NN NN IN DT NNP POS JJ NN VBD CD NN JJR NN IN CD IN PRP VBD IN CD .
