A chemist at a nearby college came up with a solution :,O O O O O O O O O O O O,DT NN IN DT JJ NN VBD RP IN DT NN :
"The frogs , due to a chemical change in the swamp water , simply could n't stay coupled long enough to reproduce successfully .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"DT NNS , JJ TO DT NN NN IN DT NN NN , RB MD RB VB VBN RB RB TO VB RB ."
