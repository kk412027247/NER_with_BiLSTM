China agreed in June to quotas in its textile exports to the EU .,B-org O O B-tim O O O O O O O O B-org O,NNP VBD IN NNP TO NNS IN PRP$ NN NNS TO DT NNP .
But millions of items of clothing manufactured in China have been blocked in European ports because China has already shipped its annual quota .,O O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O B-org O O B-geo O O O O O O O,CC NNS IN NNS IN NN VBN IN NNP VBP VBN VBN IN JJ NNS IN NNP VBZ RB VBN PRP$ JJ NN .
The quotas are designed to protect European textile manufacturers from low-priced Chinese competition .,O O O O O O B-org O O O O B-gpe O O,DT NNS VBP VBN TO VB JJ NN NNS IN JJ JJ NN .
Chinese textile exports surged early this year when a global system of textile quotas ended .,B-gpe O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,JJ NN NNS VBD RB DT NN WRB DT JJ NN IN JJ NNS VBD .
