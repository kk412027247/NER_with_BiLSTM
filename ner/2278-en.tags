Tsunamis are ocean waves generated by a disturbance in the sea floor .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O,NNP VBP NN NNS VBN IN DT NN IN DT NN NN .

"Geologists say tsunamis often pick up strength and speed as they travel and they become even more powerful close to shore , where the water is shallower .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"NNS VBP NNS RB VBP RP NN CC NN IN PRP VBP CC PRP VBP RB RBR JJ NN TO VB , WRB DT NN VBZ JJR ."
