U.S. support for the embattled president came into question after the Obama administration openly accused Mr. Karzai of failing to crack down on government corruption .,B-geo O O O O O O O O O O B-per O O O B-per I-per O O O O O O O O O,NNP NN IN DT JJ NN VBD IN NN IN DT NNP NN RB VBD NNP NNP IN VBG TO VB RP IN NN NN .
