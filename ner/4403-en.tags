Mr. Aso said Japan did not have to worry about being isolated because of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi 's visits to the shrine since the only countries complaining were South Korea and China .,B-per I-per O B-geo O O O O O O O O O O B-per I-per I-per I-per O O O O O O O O O O O B-geo I-geo O B-geo O,NNP NNP VBD NNP VBD RB VB TO VB IN VBG VBN IN IN NNP NNP NNP NNP POS NNS TO DT NN IN DT JJ NNS VBG VBD NNP NNP CC NNP .
