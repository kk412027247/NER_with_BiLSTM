Lecturer John Gai Yoh of the University of South Africa ( UNISA ) in Pretoria credits the leader of the Sudanese Liberation Movement with creating a campaign that included allies beyond his base in the south .,O B-per I-per I-per O O B-org O B-geo I-geo O B-geo O O B-geo O O O O O B-gpe B-org I-org O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,NN NNP NNP NNP IN DT NNP IN NNP NNP LRB NNP RRB IN NNP VBZ DT NN IN DT JJ NNP NNP IN VBG DT NN WDT VBD NNS IN PRP$ NN IN DT NN .
Mr. Yoh notes that his vision materialized with the comprehensive peace agreement signed last January between the former SPLA rebels and the government in Khartoum .,B-per I-per O O O O O O O O O O O O B-tim I-tim O O B-org O O O O O B-geo O,NNP NNP VBZ IN PRP$ NN VBD IN DT JJ NN NN VBN JJ NNP IN DT JJ NNP NNS CC DT NN IN NNP .
Analyst John Gai Yoh predicts that the SPLA will continue to democratize : it has created a new SPLA parliament for the south and has named a new five-man military panel to lead the movement .,O B-per I-per I-per O O O B-org O O O O O O O O O O B-org I-org O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,NN NNP NNP NNP VBZ IN DT NNP MD VB TO VB IN PRP VBZ VBN DT JJ NNP NN IN DT NN CC VBZ VBN DT JJ JJ JJ NN TO VB DT NN .
