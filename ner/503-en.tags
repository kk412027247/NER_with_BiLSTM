"A large body of recent oceanographic research has shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current ( ACC ) , an ocean current that flows from west to east around Antarctica , plays a crucial role in global ocean circulation .",O O O O O O O O O O O B-nat I-nat I-nat O B-nat O O O O O O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O O O O,"DT JJ NN IN JJ JJ NN VBZ VBN IN DT NNP NNP NNP LRB NNP RRB , DT NN NN WDT VBZ IN NN TO JJ IN NNP , VBZ DT JJ NN IN JJ NN NN ."
"The region where the cold waters of the ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with the seasons , but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a unique ecologic region .",O O O O O O O O B-nat O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-org I-org O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"DT NN WRB DT JJ NNS IN DT NNP VBP CC VBP IN DT NN NNS IN DT NN VBZ DT JJ NN IN DT NNP NNP : WDT VBZ IN DT NNS , CC WDT VBZ DT JJ NN IN NN CC DT JJ JJ NN ."

"In the spring of 2000 , the International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean , Indian Ocean , and Pacific Ocean .",O O B-tim I-tim I-tim O O B-org I-org I-org O O O O O O O B-org O O O O O O O B-geo I-geo O O O O O O O O B-geo I-geo O B-geo I-geo O O B-geo I-geo O,"IN DT NN IN CD , DT NNP NNP NNP VBD TO VB DT NNS IN DT NN IN DT JJ NN NN IN DT NNP NNP : IN VBG DT JJ NNS IN DT NNP NNP , NNP NNP , CC NNP NNP ."
"The Southern Ocean extends from the coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude , which coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the extent of the Antarctic Convergence .",O B-geo I-geo O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O O O O O B-org I-org I-org O O O O O O O B-org I-org O,"DT NNP NNP VBZ IN DT NN IN NNP NN TO CD NNS JJ NN , WDT VBZ IN DT NNP NNP NNP CC WDT VBZ DT NN IN DT NNP NNP ."
"As such , the Southern Ocean is now the fourth largest of the world 's five oceans ( after the Pacific Ocean , Atlantic Ocean , and Indian Ocean , but larger than the Arctic Ocean ) .",O O O O B-geo I-geo O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-geo I-geo O B-geo I-geo O O B-geo I-geo O O O O O B-geo I-geo O O,"IN JJ , DT NNP NNP VBZ RB DT JJ JJS IN DT NN POS CD NNS LRB IN DT NNP NNP , NNP NNP , CC NNP NNP , CC JJR IN DT NNP NNP RRB ."
