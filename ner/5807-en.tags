The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says climate change may hurt food production in tropical areas .,O B-org I-org I-org I-org I-org I-org O O O O O O O O O O O,DT NNP NNPS NNP CC NNP NNP VBZ NN NN MD VB NN NN IN JJ NNS .
FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf told an audience in India Tuesday that crop yields will probably fall in the seasonally dry tropics as global average temperatures rise .,B-org I-org I-org I-org O O O O B-geo B-tim O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD DT NN IN NNP NNP IN NN NNS MD RB VB IN DT RB JJ NNS IN JJ NN NNS NN .
He said agriculture dependent on rain in semi-arid regions is particularly at risk .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,PRP VBD NN JJ IN NN IN JJ NNS VBZ RB IN NN .
He also said India might lose nearly one-fifth of its rain-fed cereal production .,O O O B-geo O O O B-tim O O O O O O,PRP RB VBD NNP MD VB RB NN IN PRP$ JJ NN NN .
"Diouf said small temperature increases of one to three degrees Celsius could boost crop yields in most industrialized countries , which mostly have colder climates , but that higher temperatures would hurt food production at lower altitudes .",B-org O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"NNP VBD JJ NN NNS IN CD CC CD NNS NNP MD VB NN NNS IN JJS JJ NNS , WDT RB VBP NN NNS , CC IN JJR NNS MD VB NN NN IN JJR NNS ."
