Kenya 's President Mwai Kibaki says he will take decisive action within days in the multi-million-dollar corruption scandals rocking his government .,B-geo O B-per I-per I-per O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,NNP POS NNP NNP NNP VBZ PRP MD VB JJ NN IN NNS IN DT JJ NN NNS VBG PRP$ NN .
His pledge Thursday came after Kenya 's former anti-corruption chief told British television that he came under high-level pressure in 2004 to abandon a fraud investigation .,O O B-tim O O B-geo O O O O O B-gpe O O O O O O O O B-tim O O O O O O,PRP$ NN NNP VBD IN NNP POS JJ NN NN VBD JJ NN IN PRP VBD IN JJ NN IN CD TO VB DT NN NN .
The BBC played excerpts of a tape John Githongo says he recorded when Kenya 's then-Justice Minister Kiraitu Murungi pressed him to give up the probe .,O B-org O O O O O B-per I-per O O O O B-geo O O O B-per I-per O O O O O O O O,DT NNP VBD NNS IN DT NN NNP NNP VBZ PRP VBD WRB NNP POS NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD PRP TO VB RP DT NN .
"Githongo , who left Kenya last year , has linked Murungi and other top Kenyan officials to a massive corruption scandal , known as the "" Anglo-Leasing "" affair that diverted more than $ 200 million from the government .",B-per O O O B-geo O O O O O B-per O O O B-gpe O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"NNP , WP VBD NNP JJ NN , VBZ VBN NNP CC JJ JJ JJ NNS TO DT JJ NN NN , VBN IN DT RQU JJ RQU NN IN VBN JJR IN $ CD CD IN DT NN ."
