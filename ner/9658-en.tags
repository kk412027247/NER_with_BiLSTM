A glacial lake in southern Chile suddenly disappeared this week in a phenomenon that scientists are attributing to global warming .,O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,DT JJ NN IN JJ NNP RB VBD DT NN IN DT NN IN NNS VBP VBG TO JJ NN .
Scientists say higher than normal temperatures caused the Colonia glacier to melt into nearby Cachet Lake .,O O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O O B-geo I-geo O,NNS VBP JJR IN JJ NNS VBD DT NNP NN TO VB IN JJ NNP NNP .
"The melting ice filled the lake and put tremendous pressure on it , causing the water to eventually burrow a tunnel through the glacier .",O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,"DT VBG NN VBD DT NN CC VBD JJ NN IN PRP , VBG DT NN TO RB VB DT NN IN DT NN ."
