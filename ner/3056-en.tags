A spokesman for the office of Prime Minister Tony Blair said Thursday that what is important is not a timetable but to help Iraq while it determines its own future .,O O O O O O B-per O B-per I-per O B-tim O O O O O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O,DT NN IN DT NN IN NNP NNP NNP NNP VBD NNP IN WP VBZ JJ VBZ RB DT NN CC TO VB NNP IN PRP VBZ PRP$ JJ NN .

"He was responding to a report in London 's Daily Telegraph newspaper , which quoted an unnamed government source as reporting that the Blair administration hopes to have the United States agree to announce a timetable .",O O O O O O O B-geo O B-geo I-geo O O O O O O O O O O O O B-per O O O O O B-geo I-geo O O O O O O,"PRP VBD VBG TO DT NN IN NNP POS NNP NNP NN , WDT VBD DT JJ NN NN IN NN IN DT NNP NN VBZ TO VB DT NNP NNPS VBP TO VB DT NN ."
The newspaper report said that setting the timetable would be an indication that U.S.-led coalition troops do not intend to stay in Iraq indefinitely .,O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-geo O O,DT NN NN VBD IN VBG DT NN MD VB DT NN IN JJ NN NNS VBP RB VB TO VB IN NNP RB .
