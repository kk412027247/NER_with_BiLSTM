Iranian banks have long been denied access to the U.S. financial system but are able to access the system indirectly through third-country banks .,B-gpe O O O O O O O O B-geo O O O O O O O O O O O O O O,JJ NNS VBP RB VBN VBN NN TO DT NNP JJ NN CC VBP JJ TO VB DT NN RB IN JJ NNS .
The ban effectively cuts off Bank Saderat from the U.S. financial system .,O O O O O B-org I-org O O B-geo O O O,DT NN RB VBZ RP NNP NNP IN DT NNP JJ NN .
